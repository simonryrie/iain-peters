export const description: string = `<i>The Corridor</i> is a gripping story of how mountains, climbing and secret shame can shape a life.

Wild places, vivid characters and turbulent relationships frame a narrative of extraordinary emotional survival in the face of childhood rape.

We follow Iain to Kenya, across Dartmoor, Cornwall, The Alps and the remote, unclimbed peaks of the Cordillera Darwin in Tierra del Fuego. We come to know his eccentric grandfather, a retired Admiral, who inspired in Iain a love of rock climbing that would become his lifeline.

Writing powerfully from the perspective of both child and adult, Iain shares his funny, rebellious, unconventional journey to escape from hidden pain, through disturbing career choices, disastrous mistakes, irrepressible optimism, a menage à trois, expeditions to South America before finally meeting and falling in love with his future wife and mother of his children in the islands of Cape Horn.

This is a uniquely riveting adventure story of physical daring and rare emotional insight.`;

		quote: `…in five decades of devouring climbing literature, I’ve never read anything that comes close to the emotional impact of Iain’s life story. …this extraordinary and ultimately uplifting book… offers a remarkable story of survival, a beautiful sense of time and place, the value of strong non-judgemental relationships, and the joy of the outdoors and time spent on rock and ice.`,

		quote: `Iain Peters’ book is about the survival, recovery, and creation of a life after being
		sexually abused as a child. It is beautifully written, full of detail that paints a vivid
		picture of place, time, events, and relationships without a consuming focus on the
		brutality or any attempt to elicit emotion in the reader. It is both intelligent and
		compassionate, portraying the long-term impact of the abuse through his life as a
		climber and offering critical analysis and deep insight into his own behaviour patterns
		and responses. Of the many aspects that make this an outstanding book are how he
		understands his rejection of power, authority and the values that sustain those
		systems, his identification of the crucial factors necessary to recover and thrive, and
		his explanation of why it is so difficult to talk about sexual assault and why people
		stay in or return to an abusive relationship. The focus on survival strategies and
		reflective analysis is what makes it possible to read this book without falling into a pit
		of despair and instead to recognise a life fulfilled and lived with joy despite its early
		trauma.`,

		quote: `’The Corridor’, a memoir about the trauma of childhood sexual abuse, and the
		profound influence that had on the author, a leading UK climber and teacher, isn’t
		easy to put down. His pitch perfect writing leads you into his world; I was left feeling I
		had been on that fearful corridor and experienced almost first-hand the thrill of the
		cliff edge, the deliberate turning away from the prescribed English boarding school
		route to Cambridge, and all the adventures that followed. There is a universal quality
		to the writing, which makes it widely accessible and gives voice - and hope - to the
		men and women who have experiences that echo Iain Peters’ own but struggle to
		articulate those dark places.`,
