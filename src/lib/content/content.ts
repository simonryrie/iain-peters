export const description: string = `<i>The Corridor</i> is a gripping story of how mountains, climbing and secret shame can shape a life.

Wild places, vivid characters and turbulent relationships frame a narrative of extraordinary emotional survival in the face of childhood rape.

We follow Iain to Kenya, across Dartmoor, Cornwall, The Alps and the remote, unclimbed peaks of the Cordillera Darwin in Tierra del Fuego. We come to know his eccentric grandfather, a retired Admiral, who inspired in Iain a love of rock climbing that would become his lifeline.

Writing powerfully from the perspective of both child and adult, Iain shares his funny, rebellious, unconventional journey to escape from hidden pain, through disturbing career choices, disastrous mistakes, irrepressible optimism, a menage à trois, expeditions to South America before finally meeting and falling in love with his future wife and mother of his children in the islands of Cape Horn.

This is a uniquely riveting adventure story of physical daring and rare emotional insight.`;
