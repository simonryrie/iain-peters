export const description: string = `<i>The Corridor</i> is a gripping story of how mountains, climbing and secret shame can shape a life.

Wild places, vivid characters and turbulent relationships frame a narrative of extraordinary emotional survival in the face of childhood rape.

We follow Iain to Kenya, across Dartmoor, Cornwall, The Alps and the remote, unclimbed peaks of the Cordillera Darwin in Tierra del Fuego. We come to know his eccentric grandfather, a retired Admiral, who inspired in Iain a love of rock climbing that would become his lifeline.

Writing powerfully from the perspective of both child and adult, Iain shares his funny, rebellious, unconventional journey to escape from hidden pain, through disturbing career choices, disastrous mistakes, irrepressible optimism, a menage à trois, expeditions to South America before finally meeting and falling in love with his future wife and mother of his children in the islands of Cape Horn.

This is a uniquely riveting adventure story of physical daring and rare emotional insight.`;

		quote: `In his memoir, Iain Peters recounts his life as a climber and teacher, revealing how his passion for wild places and adventure served as a means of survival and a form of recovery from childhood sexual abuse. He candidly explores the long-term impact of this trauma on his psyche and relationships, finding strength in the mountains in the emotional journey of healing. The book is a powerful story of hope, resilience, and the creation of a life fulfilled despite an early, horrific trauma. …   In the end it is the quality of the writing, how the books impact on the reader, and how long they remained in our minds that formed the judges’ decision. …The writing of this book was an immensely brave undertaking. Our decision was unanimous – This year’s Boardman Tasker Award is awarded to The Corridor by Iain Peters.`,

		quote: `Iain Peters’ book is about the survival, recovery, and creation of a life after being
		sexually abused as a child. It is beautifully written, full of detail that paints a vivid
		picture of place, time, events, and relationships without a consuming focus on the
		brutality or any attempt to elicit emotion in the reader. It is both intelligent and
		compassionate, portraying the long-term impact of the abuse through his life as a
		climber and offering critical analysis and deep insight into his own behaviour patterns
		and responses. One of the many aspects that make this an outstanding book is how he
		understands his rejection of power, authority and the values that sustain those
		systems, his identification of the crucial factors necessary to recover and thrive, and
		his explanation of why it is so difficult to talk about sexual assault and why people
		stay in or return to an abusive relationship. The focus on survival strategies and
		reflective analysis is what makes it possible to read this book without falling into a pit
		of despair and instead to recognise a life fulfilled and lived with joy despite its early
		trauma.`,

		quote: `’The Corridor’, a memoir about the trauma of childhood sexual abuse, and the

		cliff edge, the deliberate turning away from the prescribed English boarding school
		route to Cambridge, and all the adventures that followed. There is a universal quality
		to the writing, which makes it widely accessible and gives voice - and hope - to the

		articulate those dark places.`,
