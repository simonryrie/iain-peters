export const description: string = `<i>The Corridor</i> is a gripping story of how mountains, climbing and secret shame can shape a life.

Wild places, vivid characters and turbulent relationships frame a narrative of extraordinary emotional survival in the face of childhood rape.

We follow Iain to Kenya, across Dartmoor, Cornwall, The Alps and the remote, unclimbed peaks of the Cordillera Darwin in Tierra del Fuego. We come to know his eccentric grandfather, a retired Admiral, who inspired in Iain a love of rock climbing that would become his lifeline.

Writing powerfully from the perspective of both child and adult, Iain shares his funny, rebellious, unconventional journey to escape from hidden pain, through disturbing career choices, disastrous mistakes, irrepressible optimism, a menage à trois, expeditions to South America before finally meeting and falling in love with his future wife and mother of his children in the islands of Cape Horn.

This is a uniquely riveting adventure story of physical daring and rare emotional insight.`;

		quote: `<b>"Iain Peters’ book is about the survival</b>, recovery, and creation of a life after being sexually abused as a child. It is <b>beautifully written,</b> full of detail that paints a <b>vivid picture of place,</b> time, events, and relationships without a consuming focus on the brutality or any attempt to elicit emotion in the reader.<br><br>

			It is both <b>intelligent and compassionate,</b> portraying the long-term impact of the abuse through his life as a climber and offering critical analysis and deep insight into his own behaviour patterns and responses.<br><br>
			
			Of the many aspects that make this an <b>outstanding book</b> are how he understands his rejection of power, authority and the values that sustain those systems, his identification of the crucial factors necessary to recover and thrive, and his explanation of why it is so difficult to talk about sexual assault and why people stay in or return to an abusive relationship. The focus on survival strategies and <b>reflective analysis</b> is what makes it possible to read this book without falling into a pit of despair and instead to recognise <b>a life fulfilled and lived with joy despite its early trauma."</b>`,
