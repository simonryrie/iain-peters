export const description: string = `The Corridor is a gripping story of how mountains, climbing and secret shame can shape a
life.

Wild places, vivid characters and turbulent relationships frame a narrative of extraordinary
emotional survival in the face of childhood rape.

We follow Iain to Kenya, across Dartmoor, through the Alps and down to remote unclimbed
peaks in Tierra del Fuego. We come to know his eccentric grandfather, a retired Admiral,
who inspired in Iain a love of rock climbing that would become his lifeline.

Writing powerfully from the perspectives of both child and adult, Iain shares his funny,
rebellious, unconventional journey to escape from hidden pain, through disturbing career
choices, disastrous mistakes, irrepressible optimism, a menage à trois, expeditions to
South America before finally meeting and falling in love with his future wife and mother of
his children in the islands of Cape Horn.

This is a uniquely riveting adventure story of physical daring and rare emotional insight.`;

			'The Corridor is beautifully written, full of detail that paints a vivid picture of place, time, events and relationships without a consuming focus on the brutality. It is both intelligent and compassionate, portraying the long-term impact of the abuse through his life as a climber. The focus on survival strategies and reflective analysis is what makes it possible to read this book without falling into a pit of despair and instead to recognise a life fulfilled and lived with joy despite its early trauma.',
